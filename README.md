# Romi_Website
Full STack Project - 2025
Ralph NEEMTALLAH

Welcome to the future (also known as my tech company)! I present to you ROMI, my collection of three humanoid robots taking 3 forms: ROMI Care, ROMI Home, and ROMI Play — each tailored to specific household needs such as caregiving, organization, and family entertainment. And before you ask, yes ROMI is derived from ROUMIEH! Pretty original I know. My website showcases every detail of a futuristic robotics company, from home page to robot models and more. The site contains 4 pages, combining UX and UI design perfection. My team, which I encourage you to check in the about page, worked very hard on these robots, so I hope you like them!

APIs used: 
1)	API Ninjas Technology Quotes API: Fetches a random quote. Used on the About page for the "ROMI's Daily Wisdom" quote card, providing users with a new quote each time the page loads. It’s idea is to show users that our vision is a world where robots are seen as friends rather than enemies.
2)	Joke API (Created by me): Provides a random robot-themed joke to display on the site. Used for the "Joke of the Day" feature with the option to fetch a new one, having the same idea of making robots seem friends and encourage people to allow them into their homes. 

My custom requirement was a scroll-to-top button, which you will find on all pages on the lower right in a very dynamic appearance.

More details: 
•	Dynamic routing is used, especially in the register / sign in page.
•	Many CSS transitions are used, citing a few: buttons transitions, cards 3d effects, hover and focus effects…
•	CSS transforms for 3d effect are used as well: in the “why humanoid cards”, when hovering a card, it lifts up and rotates in 3D space, creating a real 3D effect.

N.B.: The Purchase, Register/Sign in and Send Message buttons are not functional because they need Back-End development.
